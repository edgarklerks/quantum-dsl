# Quantum simulation #

A simulation of simple quantum computations with an possibility to use different interpretations.

It contains a small DSL based on a Arrow interface to create small systems.

The file is a literal haskell file and heavily annotated. The implementation is in Quantum.hs

# BUGS #

There is a bug in composing two systems, see the quantum immortality experiment. It doesn't arrive at the correct answer.


# TODO #

Write tests to verify the code.
